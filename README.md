# Decarbonize-TH

**Decarbonize-TH** is a machine learning project to forecast Thailandâ€™s COâ‚‚ emissions and analyze how different sectors contribute to emissions. It includes model training, result tracking with MLflow, and a web interface for visualizing predictions.

---

## Quick Start

To run the full development stack locally using Docker:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

This will launch four containers:

- **mlflow** â€“ Tracks training experiments using an MLflow server.
- **model-training** â€“ Trains machine learning models and saves outputs.
- **carbon-api** â€“ A FastAPI service to serve predictions.
- **carbon-ui** â€“ The frontend of the project
