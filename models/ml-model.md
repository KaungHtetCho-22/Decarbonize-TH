### Phase 1: Predict Thailand’s CO₂ Emissions (Baseline Forecasting)

####  Planned to apply ML Models:
- ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) → Captures linear time-series trends.
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) → Deep learning for long-term dependencies.
- Prophet (by Facebook) → Handles seasonality & policy changes well.
- XGBoost/Random Forest Regression → Captures nonlinear dependencies between economic & energy factors.

Expected results: CO₂ emissions projections up to 20xx with no renewable energy expansion

### Phase 2: Model the Impact of Renewable Energy Adoption

#### Still in progress

### Useful suggestion from ChatGPT

- SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) → Identify which policies & investments impact emissions the most.
